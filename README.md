This is the new version of the VFO with si 5351. I have added SPI_TFT_COLOR_DISPLAY for radio receivers. I remind you that the project is experimental for hobbyists and homebrewing enthusiasts and can be changed without notice. Any commercial use is strictly prohibited.
ATTENTION:  Tested with >>>>>>>>ARDUINO IDE 1.8.19 <<<<<<<
